# TimSort
I decided to try and write Tim sort in C. Tim sort is described as "a sorting algorithm that is efficient for real-world 
data and not created in an academic laboratory". It is the defualt sorting algorthim used by both Java and Python.
My main source while writing this code has been

While I could just go into java and use sort and say I did it I wanted to give my self a bit more of a challange. So to write
this code I decided to write all the sorting from scratch, this includes both merge and insertion sort.

# Future steps
In the future I would love to expand upon this program by mabye adding it too a website that I will develop later. Mabye something
like uploading a tsv file and it returning a sorted tsv or something like that but one step at a time!
